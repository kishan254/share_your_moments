## Description

This is a Full MERN Stack App that uses the CRUD principles to make posts.

I was inspired by instagram and tripadvisor but wanted to create something for my friends who have now gone to study to other countries like I did when I came to Australia to study

This was a fun idea but also a project to a coding bootcamp I was doing to become a full-stack developer

In this project you will be able to login, logout, like, and share your moments of your travel.
